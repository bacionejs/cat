**Story**  
Catwoman is having a snowy run across Gotham's rooftops.  
She can hear the jazz clubs playing in the streets below.  

---
**Controls**  
There are 7 invisible jazz notes evenly spaced across the screen.  
The middle note causes her to jump.  

---
**Challenge**  
Try to play jazz while jumping.  
There is no penalty for missing a rooftop.  
There is no score, level, mission or bad guys.  

---
**Optional**  
Tap the top to mute and then play background jazz - [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6gqJPa4A4gXTwTSGWcpC1d)

## Post-mortem

## 🐾 Body Physics
 
The most interesting part of this animation is how the **shin (lower leg)** and the **torso bobbing** work together to make the cat’s stride look alive.
  
### 1. Phase delay in the shin
 
The shin doesn’t move in perfect sync with the thigh. Its motion is shifted slightly in time (`lowerDelay`), so the knee bends **after** the thigh starts swinging. This gives the motion a sense of follow-through, like muscle and tendon reaction rather than mechanical linkage.  

`let t = (sin(p - l.lowerDelay) + 1) / 2;`

### 2. Quadratic ease-in/out
 
The raw sine motion is reshaped with a **quadratic ease function**:  

`let e = t < .5 ? 2*t*t : -1 + (4 - 2*t)*t;`

This curve makes the shin:
- **Ease in** slowly from rest  
- **Accelerate** in mid-swing  
- **Ease out** to slow down at the end  

So instead of robotic motion, the shin **extends and retracts with momentum**, like a real limb.  

### 3. Range-limited extension
 
The eased value `e` then sweeps the shin angle between a **minimum bend** and a **maximum extension**:  

`let angle = u + l.lowerMin + (l.lowerMax - l.lowerMin) * e;`

- `lowerMin` keeps the knee slightly bent, even at rest.  
- `lowerMax` defines the full stretch when the paw reaches forward.  

This creates a **springy, elastic feel** as the leg folds and extends.
  
### 4. Subtle torso bobbing
 
To tie it all together, the whole torso is given a slight **up-and-down bob**:  

`let b = sin(p0*2 + PI/4) * 6 * size;`  
`let h0 = { x: h[0].x, y: h[0].y + b };`

- The bobbing is tied to **double the leg cycle frequency** (`sin(p*2)`), matching the rhythm of paw impacts.  
- The amplitude is small (just a few pixels), but it makes the cat look like it’s **absorbing impact and pushing off the ground**.  

Without this bobbing, the legs would move correctly, but the run would feel flat and mechanical. With it, the stride feels weighty and natural.
  
### 5. Physics analogy
 
- **Thigh (upper leg):** like a driven pendulum.  
- **Shin (lower leg):** a secondary pendulum with delay and easing, following the thigh.  
- **Torso bobbing:** the “mass-on-springs” effect of body weight shifting with each step.  

Together, these three effects — **delay, easing, and bobbing** — produce a run cycle that feels organic and convincing with very little code.  

👉 The lower leg physics makes the paw placement believable, and the torso bobbing seals the illusion of a real running cat.
