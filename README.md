**Story**  
Catwoman is having a snowy run across Gotham's rooftops.  
She can hear the jazz clubs playing in the streets below.  

---
**Controls**  
There are 7 invisible jazz notes evenly spaced across the screen.  
The middle note causes her to jump.  

---
**Challenge**  
üí° Try to play jazz while jumping.  
There is no penalty for missing a rooftop.  
There is no score, level, mission or bad guys.  

---
**Optional**  
Tap the top to mute and then play background jazz - [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6gqJPa4A4gXTwTSGWcpC1d)

## Post-mortem

This game is unorthodox, so it requires a little extra attention from the player to make it challenging and fun.

- First, watch the [jazz tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5WLNmErkiY) video on how to compose simple jazz.

- Then, forget about Catwoman, close your eyes and play the seven notes across the screen. Work on your improv skills, based on the tutorial you watched.

- Then, when you're confident, try to combine that with hitting the middle note at the exact time to make Catwoman jump to the next rooftop.  


It's impossible to score your improv, but you know if you've played good or not.



### üìù Backstory  

I really wanted to make a **smooth-running Catwoman**. But with no experience in drawing or animation, I decided not to worry too much about form and instead focus on capturing a **natural, fluid stride**.  

I also imagined the game with **jazz background music** ‚Äî something cool and relaxing to match the zen vibe of a snowy nighttime Gotham rooftop run.  

The problem: I‚Äôve never composed music before. I tried several tracker editors but struggled with them. Eventually, I even [built my own tracker](https://github.com/bacionejs/battito). Still, I couldn‚Äôt create a jazz piece that truly fit the mood I wanted.  

After watching countless jazz tutorials, I had an epiphany: instead of composing the perfect track myself, why not let the [player play simple jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5WLNmErkiY) ‚Äî and make one of the notes trigger the cat‚Äôs jump? Naturally, this turned into a **multitasking nightmare** üòÖ.  

In the end, you have two choices:  

- For the **Zen experience**, tap at the top to mute the in-game sound and play your own background jazz.  
- Or, if you‚Äôre feeling daring, try to **jump and play jazz at the same time** ‚Äî and see how long you last!

## üéπ Jump trigger

- **Instrument:** improvise over the jazz soundtrack with piano notes.  
Among the notes, one key is special ‚Äî when you hit the middle note, it doesn‚Äôt just play sound: it also triggers a **jump**

Catwoman does fall from the rooftop, just not very far. It's more of a gentle visual cue than a punishment. And like the instruction says, there's no penalty for missing. So she just keeps going. Anything more than that would negate the Zen vibe.


üëâ Tests your ability to multitask music and jumping.

## üêæ Body Physics
 
The most interesting part of this animation is how the **shin (lower leg)** and the **body bobbing** work together to make the body‚Äôs stride look alive.
  
### 1. Phase delay in the shin
 
The shin doesn‚Äôt move in perfect sync with the thigh. Its motion is shifted slightly in time (`lowerDelay`), so the knee bends **after** the thigh starts swinging. This gives the motion a sense of follow-through, like muscle and tendon reaction rather than mechanical linkage.  

`let t = (sin(p - l.lowerDelay) + 1) / 2;`

### 2. Quadratic ease-in/out
 
The raw sine motion is reshaped with a **quadratic ease function**:  

`let e = t < .5 ? 2*t*t : -1 + (4 - 2*t)*t;`

This curve makes the shin:
- **Ease in** slowly from rest  
- **Accelerate** in mid-swing  
- **Ease out** to slow down at the end  

So instead of robotic motion, the shin **extends and retracts with momentum**, like a real limb.  

### 3. Range-limited extension
 
The eased value `e` then sweeps the shin angle between a **minimum bend** and a **maximum extension**, in a range that looks natural:  

`let angle = u + l.lowerMin + (l.lowerMax - l.lowerMin) * e;`

### 4. Subtle body bobbing
 
To tie it all together, the whole body is given a slight **up-and-down bob**:  

`let b = sin(p0*2 + PI/4) * 6 * size;`  
`let h0 = { x: h[0].x, y: h[0].y + b };`

- The bobbing is tied to **double the leg cycle frequency** (`sin(p*2)`), matching the leg rhythm.  
- The amplitude is small (just a few pixels), but it makes the body look like it‚Äôs **absorbing impact and pushing off the ground**.  

Without this bobbing, the legs would move correctly, but the run would feel flat and mechanical. With it, the stride feels weighty and natural.
  
### 5. Physics analogy
 
- **Thigh (upper leg):** like a driven pendulum.  
- **Shin (lower leg):** a secondary pendulum with delay and easing, following the thigh.  
- **Torso bobbing:** the ‚Äúmass-on-springs‚Äù effect of body weight shifting with each step.  

Together, these three effects ‚Äî **delay, easing, and bobbing** ‚Äî produce a run cycle that feels organic and convincing with very little code.  

üëâ The lower leg physics makes the stride believable, and the body bobbing seals the illusion of a real running catwoman.
